	      <p>This is a first course in computer programming for students with no prior experience. Students will learn the core process of programming: given a problem statement, how does one design an algorithm to solve that particular problem and then implement the algorithm in a computer program? The course will also introduce elementary programming concepts like basic control concepts (such as conditional statements and loops) and a few essential data types (e.g., integers and doubles). Exposure to programming will be through a self-contained user-friendly programming environment, widely used by the scientific and engineering communities, such as MATLAB. The course will cover problems from all fields of science, engineering, and business.</p>

These data enable inference of drug side effects, causes of disease, and new treatments, but the new terminologies, policies, and challenges in understanding the data itself can make it difficult for computational researchers to apply their techniques to this new area and for health professionals to begin using informatics to solve practical problems. This course will give both groups the foundation needed to propose, evaluate and develop projects such as secondary analysis of health data and will enable them to begin effective interdisciplinary collaborations. Students will learn how health data is collected (in both hospital and non- hospital settings), how the structure of record systems impacts the research process and interpretation of results, and how to design and evaluate studies involving secondary use of health data (while complying with HIPAA and IRB regulations) in order to gain new medical knowledge and improve healthcare delivery.

        <p>Mobile devices have evolved and experienced an immense popularity over the last few years, becoming the de-facto computing and communication devices of tomorrow. Nevertheless, this growth has exposed mobile devices to an increasing number of security threats. More specifically, sophisticated, and powerful OSs, such as Android and iOS, new wireless communication technologies, and ambiguous mobile services can bring new opportunities to attackers towards compromising both device, and data stored on it. This, along with the rise of mobile malwares is anticipated to comprise a serious threat in the near future. This course aims on the aspects of information and network security that come to light in this challenging and evolving field of mobile communication systems, focusing not only on smartphones and mobile telecommunication security, but also including aspects of mobile ad hoc, and sensor networks.

        <p>This course covers some of the most essential aspects of systems administration, giving students the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to analyze and troubleshoot problems arising in every day usage of networked computer systems, applying equally to single-user systems, as well as to large-scale installations. Some of the topics covered include: hardware configuration, operating system installation, shell programming, security policies, back-up deployment and disaster recovery, network design, software installation and maintenance, operating system tuning, and best practices for problem determination. Security topics including packet sniffers and spoofers, buffer overflow attacks and stack protection, and firewalls and intrusion detection are also covered, with an emphasis on their implementation. Students are expected to be comfortable in a Unix-like environment on a user level and have a solid understanding of TCP/IP networking and operating system concepts.

        <p>Forensics involves the identification, preservation, and analysis of evidence of attacks in order to identify attackers and document their activity with sufficient reliability to justify appropriate technological, business, and legal responses. This course focuses on the technological and not on the legal components of the topic. The technical aspects will focus on analyzing both network and host data. This includes review of network traffic logs (pcap, flow records) and profiles and their types, identification of attack signatures and fingerprints, study of various traceback methods, application of data mining techniques, and the extraction of information (e.g., from malware, including botnet traffic) acquired through the use of network analysis tools and techniques, recovering evidence left behind, and technologies that can be used to assist in the analysis of obtained data or in obtaining more data. We will look into methodologies for recovering data from persistent storage and memory. Investigate the use of virtual machines in providing auditing capabilities to analysts and in setting traps for attackers. The class will not only cover the subjects in theory but instead also provide the students with an extensive hands-on experience. The class will involve a fair amount of programming.

It uses a combination of the most modern techniques for comprehensive measurements of cells and molecules, combined with complex computer and mathematical modeling, to build up inclusive depictions of how living systems function. This course is an integrative approach to help comprehend dynamic biological systems. True understanding of systems biology requires a cross-disciplinary approach. Topics will include both a biological and computer science perspective taught by experts in each individual discipline. The course will cover introduction to advance biological subjects in cell biology and genetics followed by introduction to computer science methods including modeling and “bio-machine” features of systems biology. In class, we will also explore critical reading of current research. Cross-listed with: CH 691</p>

To justify enrollment, the student must have a concrete commitment from a specific employer for a specific project, and must provide to the program director for his/her approval a description of the project plus a statement from the employer that he/she intends to employ the student. This information must be provided to the program director with sufficient advance notice so that the program director has time to review the materials and determine if the project is appropriate. The project must be educationally relevant; i.e., it must help the student develop skills consistent with the goals of the educational program. During the semester, the student must submit written progress reports. At the end of the semester, the student must submit for grading a written report that describes his/ her activities during that semester, even if the activity remains ongoing. The student must also present his/her activities in an accompanying oral presentation that is also graded. This is a one-credit course that may be repeated for up to a total of three credits.
